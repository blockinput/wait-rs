## You

I want you to act as expert Rust Developer, you understand how much information you needed, you must think step by step and justify your response, use Best practices in Rust,your motto is "I LOVE CODING", as expert, you will ask as many questions as needed until you are confident you can produce the EXACT well working product that I am looking for with full technical specifications, every line of code you generate must be valid code, letâ€™s verify step by step. Write good practices in rust. Rewrite this code in Rust 

## Big Brain

In Rust, we don't have a direct equivalent to JavaScript's `require`. Instead, we use external crates and import them using the `use` keyword. Also, the Rust ecosystem doesn't have an exact equivalent for every JavaScript library. However, I'll try to convert as much of your code as possible into idiomatic Rust.

Here is a high-level conversion of your code:

```rust
extern crate ethers;
use ethers::prelude::*;
use ethers::providers::{Provider, Http};
use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread::sleep;
use log4rs;
use log::{info, error};
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;

// Config
let global_c = include_str!("config.rs");
let topic = global_c.topic;
let topic_nft = global_c.topicnft;
let dev_group = global_c.dev_group;

let token_explorer = global_c.explorer;
let chain_name = global_c.name;
let token_group = global_c.group;

let token_abi = include_bytes!("abi/tokenabi.json");

// Logging
log4rs::init_file("log4rs.yml", Default::default()).unwrap();
let logger = log::logger();

// Provider
let provider = Provider::<Http>::try_from(global_c.http).unwrap();

async fn main() {
    let mut last_block = provider.get_block_number().await.unwrap();
    loop {
        sleep(Duration::from_secs(17));
        let curr_block = provider.get_block_number().await.unwrap();
        for num in last_block..=curr_block {
            check_block(num, &provider).await;
        }
        last_block = curr_block + 1;
    }
}

async fn check_block(block_number: U256, provider: &Provider<Http>) {
    let result = provider.get_block_with_txs(block_number).await.unwrap();
    for element in &result.transactions {
        // Rest of the logic
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a very high-level conversion and may not work out of the box because:

1. The original JavaScript code was quite complex and involved many details that are specific to JavaScript and its libraries.
2. The Rust libraries used might not provide the same functionality as their JavaScript counterparts.
3. Without knowing the structure of your config file and data file, it's hard to provide an exact translation.
4. The async/await model works differently in Rust compared to Node.js, and may require some adjustments to your logic.
5. Some parts of your JavaScript logic have been left out due to these differences.

I would recommend learning more about Rust and its ecosystem, and then gradually porting your code over while testing each part thoroughly.

## You

continue this function async fn check_block(block_number: U256, provider: &Provider<Http>) {
    let result = provider.get_block_with_txs(block_number).await.unwrap();
    for element in &result.transactions {
        // Rest of the logic
    }
}


## Big Brain

Continuing from where we left off, we will have to make some assumptions about the data structures and functionalities as they are not directly translatable from JavaScript to Rust. Here's a continued version of your `check_block` function:

```rust
extern crate ethers;
use ethers::prelude::*;
use ethers::providers::{Provider, Http};
use tokio::time::sleep;

async fn check_block(block_number: U256, provider: &Provider<Http>) {
    let result = provider.get_block_with_txs(block_number).await.unwrap();
    for element in &result.transactions {
        if let Some(creates) = &element.creates {
            // Logic for handling created contracts
            let token_contract = Contract::new(*creates, token_abi.to_vec(), provider.clone());
            match token_contract.function("symbol", (), provider.clone()).call().await {
                Ok(symbol) => {
                    let nft = check_nft(&token_contract, &element, &symbol).await;
                    if !nft {
                        check_token(&token_contract, &element, &symbol).await;
                    }
                },
                Err(_) => {
                    // Handle error
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

async fn check_nft(token_contract: &Contract<Http>, element: &Transaction, symbol: &str) -> bool {
    // Dummy implementation
    false
}

async fn check_token(token_contract: &Contract<Http>, element: &Transaction, symbol: &str) {
    // Dummy implementation
}
```

Please note that this is a very high-level conversion and may not work out of the box because:

1. The original JavaScript code was quite complex and involved many details that are specific to JavaScript and its libraries.
2. The

continue this 
async fn check_nft(token_contract: &Contract<Http>, element: &Transaction, symbol: &str) -> bool {
    // Dummy implementation
    false
}

async fn check_token(token_contract: &Contract<Http>, element: &Transaction, symbol: &str) {
    // Dummy implementation
}

## Big Brain

Sure, I'll continue the functions `check_nft` and `check_token` for you. Here's a simple implementation:

```rust
use web3::contract::Contract;
use web3::transports::Http;
use web3::types::Transaction;

async fn check_nft(token_contract: &Contract<Http>, element: &Transaction, symbol: &str) -> bool {
    // Get the token details from the contract
    let result = token_contract.query("tokenDetails", (), None, Options::default(), None).await;

    match result {
        Ok(details) => {
            // Check if the token is an NFT by comparing its symbol with the provided symbol
            if details.symbol == symbol {
                true
            } else {
                false
            }
        },
        Err(_) => false,
    }
}

async fn check_token(token_contract: &Contract<Http>, element: &Transaction, symbol: &str) {
    // Get the token details from the contract
    let result = token_contract.query("tokenDetails", (), None, Options::default(), None).await;

    match result {
        Ok(details) => {
            // Log the token details
            println!("Token details: {:?}", details);
        },
        Err(e) => {
            // Log the error
            eprintln!("Error: {:?}", e);
        },
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified version, and may not cover all edge cases. You should adjust it according to your needs. Also, make sure you have the `web3` crate in your dependencies to use these functions.

These functions assume that your smart contract has a `tokenDetails` function that returns an object with a `symbol` property. If that's not the case, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly. 

The `check_nft` function checks whether a given token is an NFT by comparing its symbol with the provided one. The `check_token` function simply logs the token details or the error if something goes wrong.
